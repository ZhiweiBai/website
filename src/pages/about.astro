  <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">Motivation</h2>

  Deep learning has achieved great success, but understanding how it works is
  essential for building better and safer AI systems. Deep learning is a highly
  complex system. Studying phenomena—observable patterns in experiments—is a key
  way to understand such complexity. This approach mirrors how scientists study
  nature: through controlled experiments, they discover empirical laws that
  guide theory, which in turn leads to deeper understanding and useful
  technology.

  <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">Objectives</h2>

  This project collects important phenomena in deep learning and provides a
  platform for researchers to share and discuss their findings. By gathering
  well-documented phenomena with reproducible experiments, we aim to help
  researchers identify open questions, connect theory with practice, and advance
  the field together.

  <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">Contributions</h2>

  This project is a collaborative effort of researchers from various
  institutions. We welcome contributions from researchers and practitioners in
  the field of deep learning. You can contribute a phenomenon by submitting a
  Markdown file to the project, or submit an information of a related paper to
  an existing phenomenon. Please see the

  > for more details. We encourage researchers to share their findings and contribute
  to the collective understanding of deep learning phenomena.
